				MODULE 4

Objective:

The objective of this learning is to understand the role of function in python and how to use them. Also I will be learning tuples, dictionaries, exceptions, code structuring, function invocation and returning results from function, name scopes and variable shadowing. And after this build simple project using python. Still Thinking on the project.
